# Java 8 Lambda Expression

Lambda Expression was introduced in Java 8. It represents a functional interface with an expression. It is very powerful feature when used with collections. It can easily filter, sort, iterarte data in collections. Lambda expression can be used for any purpose. It saves a lot of code and time.

**Functional Interface :**  
Functional Interface is an interface which has exactly one method. In java, a functional interface can be represented using @FunctionalInterface annotation. However this annotation is optional, because Java automatically detects an interface as functional interface if it has only one method.

**Syntax :**  
> (arguments-list) -> { body }  

1. **Argument List** represents the arguments of the funcion body. It can be empty or non empty.
2. **Arrow symbol** is used to link *Argument List* and *Body*
3. **Body** it contains expression, business logic, or statements of Lambda Expresion.
