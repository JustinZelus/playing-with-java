Functional interface also known as **SAM Interface** _(Single Abstract Method)_. Because they can have any number of **static** or **default** methods, but they can have only one **abstract** method. This feature was introduced in Java 8 to be used with _Functional Programming_ and _Lambda Expressions_.

> Functional interface is an interface which has exactly one abstract method. In java, functional interfaces are denoted by **@FunctionalInterface** annotation.
