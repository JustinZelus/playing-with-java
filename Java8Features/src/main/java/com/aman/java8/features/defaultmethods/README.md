# Java 8: Default Methods
Java 8 introduced feature to provide implementation of methods inside an interface. These methods are called default methods.    

> Default methods have default implementation and tagged with **default** keyword. These methods are non-abstract methods. A non-abstract method can also have static keyword and also have implementation inside an interface.

**Default Method :**  
Default Methods are non-abstract methods having default keyword and implementation inside an interface. They can be used in functional interface since they are non-abstract methods.  

**Static Method :**
Static methods are non-abstract methods having static keyword and may have implementation inside interface. They can also be used in functional interface since they are non-abstract methods.  

**Abstract Class :**
An abstract class is same as Java interface. The difference is abstract class can have constructor but interfaces cannot.
