# Java 8: Type Annotations
Java 8 has included two new features repeating and type annotations in its prior annotations topic. In early Java versions, you can apply annotations only to declarations. After releasing of Java SE 8 , annotations can be applied to any type use. It means that annotations can be used anywhere you use a type.  

![Type Annotations](https://github.com/amanver16/ebooks_cheatsheets/blob/master/Images/Type%20Annotations%20Java%208.jpg) 

## Some Type Annotations
**@NonNull :** To avoid NullPointerExceptions. (*lombok.NonNull*)  
**@NonNegative :** To avoid negative values. (*javax.annotation.NonNegative*)  
**@Retention :** Specifies how the marked annotation is storedâ€”Whether in code only, compiled into the class, or available at runtime through reflection. (*java.lang.annotation.Retention*)  
**@Repeatable :** Specifies that the annotation can be applied more than once to the same declaration, since Java 8. (*java.lang.annotation.Repeatable*)  
**@interface :** Used to write user defined annotation. May or may not contain default value. The **default** keyword can be used with the interface/annotation attributes, because they don't have their own constructor.  

### Examples

1. **@NonNull** String str;  
2. **@NonNull** List\<String> nameList;
3. List\<**@NonNull** String> list;
4. Arrays\<**@NonNegative** Integer> numbers;
5. **@Encrypted** File file;
6. **@Open** Connection connection; 

### Java Repeating Annotations
In Java 8 release, Java allows you to repeating annotations in your source code. It is helpful when you want to reuse annotation for the same class. You can repeat an annotation anywhere that you would use a standard annotation.

For compatibility reasons, repeating annotations are stored in a container annotation that is automatically generated by the Java compiler. In order for the compiler to do this, two declarations are required in your code.

1. **Declare a repeatable annotation type** : Declaring of repeatable annotation type must be marked with the @Repeatable meta-annotation. The value of the @Repeatable meta-annotation, in parentheses, is the type of the container annotation that the Java compiler generates to store repeating annotations.  

```java
@Repeatable(ContainingAnnotationClass.class)
public @interface AnnotationClass {
    public return_type attributeName();
    public return_type attributeName();
    ...
}
```
2. **Declare the containing annotation type** : Containing annotation type must have a value element with an array type. The component type of the array type must be the repeatable annotation type.  

```java
@Retention(Specify_Retention_Policy)
public @interface ContainingAnnotationClass {
    AnnotationClass[] value();
}
```

> Compiler will throw a compile-time error, if you apply the same annotation to a declaration without first declaring it as repeatable.
